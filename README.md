# Family-Financial-Data-project
Financial Insights Dashboard and Scoring Model
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing family financial data to identify patterns, calculate financial health scores, and provide actionable insights. The key objectives include:
1.	Analyzing spending and savings patterns.
2.	Developing a scoring mechanism (range: 0–100) for evaluating financial health.
3.	Visualizing insights using Python libraries.
4.	Implementing a model to provide recommendations.

Scoring Logic
The scoring mechanism evaluates each family's financial health using the following factors:
Factor	Weight (%)	Description
Savings-to-Income Ratio	30	Higher savings improve the score.
Monthly Expenses as % Income	25	Lower expenses improve the score.
Loan Payments as % Income	20	Lower loan payments improve the score.
Credit Card Spending Trends	15	Controlled credit card spending improves the score.
Financial Goals Met (%)	10	Higher goal completion rates improve the score.
Scoring Formula
python
total_score = savings_score + expenses_score + loan_score + cc_score + goals_score

Visualizations
Key Insights:
1.	Family Financial Scores:
o	Bar plot showing financial health scores of all families.
2.	Spending Distribution:
o	Histogram depicting the spending-to-income ratio across families.
3.	Spending Categories:
o	Pie chart showing the proportion of spending across different categories.

Recommendations
The model provides actionable insights for families with low scores:
•	Reduce expenses if spending exceeds 50% of income.
•	Increase savings to at least 20% of income.
•	Control loan payments to stay below 30% of income.
